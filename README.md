# Assignments - Jala Academy

This repository contains various Python assignments and projects as part of the Jala Academy program. The main focus is on practicing and showcasing foundational and intermediate skills in Python, NumPy, Pandas, and data analysis.

## Contents

- **Jala_Academy_Project.ipynb**: The central notebook includes solutions to multiple programming tasks, predominantly using Python.
    - Basic array operations (creation, manipulation, statistics)
    - Matrix operations (identity, transpose, reshape, sub-matrix extraction)
    - Indexing and slicing, fancy indexing, reversing arrays
    - Replacing and filtering values based on conditions
    - Linear algebra: determinant, inverse, dot product, solving linear systems
    - Data import and cleaning with Pandas (CSV, handling missing values)
    - Data reshaping, filtering, and analysis
    - DataFrame and NumPy array conversions
    - Plotting and data visualization (where applicable)
    - Time difference calculations using pandas datetime

## Features

- Covers a wide range of Python and data science topics:
    - NumPy arrays and mathematical operations
    - Pandas DataFrame manipulations
    - Random data generation and filtering
    - Data cleaning techniques
    - Linear algebra
    - Data reshaping and aggregation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sathwikadonagani/Assignments-Jala-Academy-.git
   cd Assignments-Jala-Academy-
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   - Required packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` (for plotting), `jupyter` (to run notebooks).

   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Jala_Academy_Project.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Open `Jala_Academy_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Each section is self-contained and demonstrates a specific Python concept or data operation.
- You can execute cells individually to view outputs and experiment with the code.
- Modify or add new cells to practice further.
